# Business Ranking Report
1. Context

Received a request from the finance department to create these two reports and process data daily, saving the results to an Excel file on Google Drive.

2. Implementation

Flowchart:

Description of Implementation Steps:

2.1. Input Data Flow:

Use DBeaver to import data from 3 Excel files into 3 tables: fact_kpi_month, fact_txn_month, and kpi_asm_data.

2.2. Data Validation:

Write SQL scripts to verify the accuracy of the imported data.

2.3. Data Model Organization (Dimension & Fact):

Objective: Optimize storage.

* Summary Report:

    * Dimension table: dim_funding_structure

    * Fact table: fact_backdate_funding_monthly

* ASM Ranking Report:
    * Fact table: fact_backdate_asm_monthly

2.4. Create log_tracking Table:

Record the start time, end time, and any errors (if applicable) during the processing.

2.5. Create area_mapping Table:

Map area_code to the corresponding list of provinces.

2.6. Write Stored Procedure:

When passing the target month as a parameter:
* Delete data for that month from the relevant tables.
* Load new processed data into the tables.
* Construct SQL queries to retrieve data in the required format for the two report sheets.

2.7. Indexing:

Create indexes on key columns from the input data to improve the performance of the Stored Procedure.

2.8. Build Queries for Sheets:

Develop SQL queries to retrieve data in the exact format required for each sheet in the resulting Excel file.

2.9. Execute with Python:

* Use Python to execute the SQL queries.

![python](./Picture/python.png)

* Modify Python code to apply custom formatting to the Excel file (e.g., set fonts, apply cell colors, adjust column widths, and configure number formats).

* Write the results to an Excel file.

2.10. Auto-Upload to Google Drive

After generating and formatting the Excel file, use Pythonâ€™s Google Drive API client to authenticate (via OAuth or service account) and automatically upload or overwrite the file in a specified Drive folder.

3. Skills and Achievements After Completing the Project

Completing this project enhances tool skills, technical skills, and domain knowledge as follows:

3.1. Tool Skills

PostgreSQL / DBeaver
* Write and optimize complex queries against a PostgreSQL database.
* Use DBeaver to browse tables, run SQL scripts, and import/export data to/from Excel.

Excel / openpyxl
* Automate creation of Excel workbooks via Python (pandas.ExcelWriter + openpyxl).
* Apply cell-level formatting (fonts, fills, alignments, number formats) programmatically with openpyxl.

Python IDE (VS Code)
* Develop, debug, and run Python scripts that integrate database queries, data transformations, and Excel generation.

Google Drive API
* Authenticate via OAuth2 in a Python script (using google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib).
* Upload or overwrite files in Drive automatically using googleapiclient and MediaFileUpload.

3.2. Technical Skills
SQL
* Extract and transform reporting data from fact tables (e.g., fact_backdate_funding_monthly).
* Handle filtering, sorting, and joins to retrieve KPI columns for financial analysis.

Python
* Connect to PostgreSQL with psycopg2, execute queries, and handle exceptions to ensure safe cleanup.
* Process query results in pandas.DataFrame, including clearing specific rows/columns, scaling numeric values, and rounding.
* Generate an Excel file with pandas + openpyxl and apply:
    * Column headers styling (fonts, fills, alignment).
    * Row-and-cell-level formatting (color fills, merged headers, column widths, row heights, custom number formats).
* Integrate Google Drive upload:
    * Authenticate via InstalledAppFlow or service account.
    * Build a Drive client (build('drive', 'v3', ...)) and use MediaFileUpload to push the finalized Excel file to a specified folder.
    * Automate the upload step so that every script run overwrites or creates the report on Drive without manual intervention.


3.3. Domain Knowledge
Finance Reporting
* Understand key financial metrics (e.g., budgets, totals, regional allocations) and how they feed into monthly/quarterly reports.
* Interpret and manipulate financial KPIs for accurate presentation.

Data Management / ETL
* Extract, transform, and load (ETL) raw data from PostgreSQL into a polished Excel report.
* Validate, clean, and restructure tabular data to meet business requirements.
